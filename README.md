## 1. What is a time series?

A **`time series`** is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. For example, `stock prices over a fixed period of time`, `hotel bookings`, `ecommerce sales`, `weather cycle reports` etc.

**`Time series analysis`** comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. **`Time series forecasting`** is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
